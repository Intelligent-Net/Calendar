Universal Calendar

This library is intended to be a reference implementaation of a universal calendar library.
Mankind is on the brink of colonising other worlds, and of creating artificial habitats. We (in the west anyway) have been using a similaar caalendar for 2000 years (THe Julian calendaar which then became the Gregorian caalendar). It shows it's age, the year starts on a day that has no astronomical significaance, months have no relationship to the orbital period of Luna, days of the week vary from year to year within a week and all sorts of other problems.

A calendar that, in so far as is possible, removes the anomalies is required, and provides a framework for other planets. This is an attempt to achieve that.
